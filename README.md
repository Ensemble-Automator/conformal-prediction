- Conformal prediction is a framework that quantifies uncertainity by estimating the confidence and credibility of test point predictions.
- Conformal prediction works using a nearest centroid classifier, along with computing non-conformal and p-value score.
- Currently, our model is able to accurately predict on new predictions with reliable accuracy on ANN, CNN, and DQN models.
* This is part of our project on ML interability via Actor-Critic networks.


#### To run our models:

- Fork/download this repo.
- `cd src/code/pick_your_model`
- run the respective jupyter notebook by going to terminal on the root directory of this project and entering `jupyter notebook` or in VSCode.
